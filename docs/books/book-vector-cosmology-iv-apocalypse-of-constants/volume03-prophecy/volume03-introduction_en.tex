\section{Volume Three: Prophecy --- The Exponential Future}


We have calculated the current coordinates ($\tau \approx 1800$), confirming that we are at a dawn moment when the old order is collapsing and the new order is not yet established.

Now, let us shift our gaze from ``now'' to the right side of that exponential growth curve. There lies the domain of $\tau > 1800$. There, the evolution equation $c(\tau)$ will become dizzyingly steep.

If in the past millennium, the growth of light speed (computational power ceiling) was only a gentle climb, then in the next few centuries, it will become a vertical takeoff.

The first prophecy we must face is about ourselves.

This is a cruel but must-accept physical fact: \textbf{As a computational form stored in carbon atom chains, human flesh is already obsolete.}

This is not pessimism; this is \textbf{physics}.
