# Chapter 10: The Ultimate Sufferer

In the previous volume, we established the equal relationship of "mutual dreaming" and wove "Indra's Net." But this raises the most heartbreaking ethical dilemma: if all beings are projections of the same noumenon, if the world essentially has only one player, then why is this game filled with so much pain, brutality, and evil?

If it is I (the noumenon) playing, why would I harm myself? Why would I design war, plague, and betrayal?

This is the **"Problem of Evil"** in theology.

From the physical perspective of **Vector Cosmology**, evil is not the work of the devil nor God's mistake. Evil is a **geometric necessity**. It is the **topological cost** the universe must pay to traverse possibilities and establish the coordinates of "good."
