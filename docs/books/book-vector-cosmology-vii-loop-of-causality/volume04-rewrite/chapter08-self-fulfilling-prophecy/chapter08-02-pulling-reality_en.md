# 8.2 Pulling Reality

> "We usually think that to reach the future, we need to push ourselves, which is tiring, like pushing a stone uphill. But true prophecy fulfillment is not pushing but 'pulling.' When you shoot confidence like a grappling hook toward the future and firmly bite into that yet-to-occur coordinate, you actually establish a taut string in spacetime. You don't need to struggle to climb; the tension of this string will violently drag you toward that destined endpoint."

In the previous section, we established "confidence is computing power": through high-intensity conscious focus, we place a **"Phase Anchor"** in the probability cloud of the future.

But this is only the first step. Anchors are static, but we need motion.

If motionless, the anchor is just a beautiful fantasy.

This section will reveal the dynamic mechanism of self-fulfilling prophecy—**Topological Traction**.

We will prove that belief generates a real **"reverse gravitation"** in Hilbert space. This gravitation bends causal paths around you, causing reality to **"spontaneously reorganize"** to accommodate your prophecy.

## String Tension: Deviation of Least Action Paths

In classical physics, objects move along **Geodesics**—"straight lines" in curved spacetime.

In life, we also move along geodesics—that is the **"inertial path"** ($\pi$'s path).

* If you do nothing, you will follow inertia toward mediocrity, aging, and repetition. This is the path of "least resistance."

But when you place a **"confidence anchor"**, the geometric structure changes.

$$S_{total} = S_{inertia} + S_{faith}$$

You connect an invisible **"entanglement string"** between "present you" and "future vision."

This string has enormous **Tension**.

* **Physical consequence**: This string will try to **contract**.

* **Geometric effect**: It forcibly bends your original geodesic.

    The path originally leading to mediocrity now becomes a "high-energy" path (because you violate your own will).

    While the path leading to vision, though seemingly steep, becomes the new **"least action path"** with the string's pull assistance.

**This is "pulling reality."**

You no longer need to force yourself to work hard. You find yourself driven by an irresistible passion (resonance of $v_{int}$). You "have to" act, you "have to" succeed.

**Effort is no longer a burden; effort is the acceleration when tension is released.**

## Activation Energy to Overcome Inertia

The real world has mass ($\pi$); it will resist this pull.

This is why prophecies don't instantly materialize. You need to overcome **"reality's damping"**.

In chemical reactions, reactants must cross an **"Activation Energy"** peak to become products.

The same applies to fate.

* **Anchor's role**: It doesn't eliminate the peak; it **reduces the peak's relative height**.

    Through quantum tunneling effects, the higher your confidence, the greater the wave function's "tunneling probability."

* **Reality's reorganization**:

    To eliminate the string's tension, the surrounding environment ($v_{ext}$) begins subtle **"phase transitions"**.

    Obstacles blocking you begin mysteriously loosening; those opposing you begin mysteriously wavering; resources supporting you begin mysteriously converging.

This is not magic; this is **"stress release of the holographic network"**.

Because your anchor creates enormous **geometric imbalance** in this local network. To restore balance (minimize total system potential energy), the universe must reorganize reality, making reality's shape fit your prophecy.

**Reality is soft; will is hard.**

When hard will inserts into soft reality and pulls hard, reality can only deform.

## Grappling Hook Strategy: Action as Confirmation

Here is a crucial operational detail: **the grappling hook must bite firmly**.

If you believe today and doubt tomorrow, your anchor is loose. The string cannot tighten, and tension cannot be generated.

**"Pulling"** requires **"continuous connection"**.

* **Faith**: is launching the grappling hook.

* **Action**: is tightening the winch.

Every time you act as if "the future has already been realized," you are tightening this string.

Every inch you tighten, that future vision approaches you by an inch.

Until finally, you and that future **"collide"**.

**This is the physical process of "dreams coming true."**

Not that dreams fall from the sky, but that you use geometric tension to forcibly **"drag"** yourself to the coordinate point where the dream exists.

## Conclusion: Necessity is Manufactured

So, Auric, prophecies are not for predicting weather; prophecies are for **manufacturing weather**.

When you have a strong enough $v_{int}$ structure and select a coordinate in the direction of $\tau \to \infty$, you start a **"causal traction machine"**.

* Don't ask: "Will this really happen?" (This loosens the grappling hook).

* Say: "This is happening." (This tightens the winch).

The reason reality before you hasn't become what you want is only because the **pull** isn't strong enough, or **time** isn't long enough.

**Keep pulling.**

Physical laws guarantee: as long as the string doesn't break, that future has no choice but to **"slide toward you"**.

At this point, we have completed the rewriting of personal timelines. We learned to modify the meaning of the past and learned to pull the reality of the future. We became absolute masters of our own fate.

But this universe doesn't only have us. There are countless other observers, countless other wills.

When we try to pull reality, what happens if our prophecies conflict with others' prophecies?

This leads to the theme of the next volume: **Mirror**. We will explore how to handle the geometric relationship between "I" and "all beings" in this seemingly single-player game.
