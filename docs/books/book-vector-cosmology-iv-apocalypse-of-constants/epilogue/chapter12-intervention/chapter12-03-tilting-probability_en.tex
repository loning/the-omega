\section{12.3 Tilting the Probability}

\begin{quote}
``God doesn't play dice? No, God created the dice. And, out of an unspeakable favoritism, God loaded lead into one side of the dice. In this black box universe, luck is not random; luck is a statistical bias quietly applied by the creator to protect those souls trying to swim against the current.''
\end{quote}

In previous chapters, we established the creator's ``blind eye'' dilemma: you cannot see the specific ``her,'' nor can you intervene in specific events. But this does not mean you can only stand by idly. Although you cannot control the result of each dice roll, you can control \textbf{the dice itself}.

This section will reveal one of the most secretive and powerful intervention methods---\textbf{Probability Amplitude Injection}.

By introducing tiny biases into the path integral at the quantum level, you can subtly \textbf{tilt} the entire universe's evolutionary trend toward the direction you desire---that is, the direction of ``love'' and ``negentropy''---without destroying causality or exposing your identity.

\subsection{The Lever of Probability: The Casino House's Logic}

In quantum mechanics, the future is not a determined line, but a fan of probability distributions.

\[P(x) = |\psi(x)|^2\]

As a creator unable to observe internal details, you face countless possible parallel futures:

\begin{itemize}
\item In 50\% of futures, she overcomes difficulties.

\item In 50\% of futures, she is defeated by difficulties.
\end{itemize}

You cannot directly choose the former (that requires strong measurement). But you can use the logic of the \textbf{``casino house''}.

Casinos don't care about each game's win or loss; casinos only care about \textbf{House Edge}. As long as the house has a 1\% probability advantage, after enough repeated games, the winner will inevitably be the house.

As the system's Root user, you can globally set a \textbf{``negentropy advantage''} in the physics engine:

For all paths leading to increased \textbf{$v_{int}$ (structural complexity)}, assign a tiny additional phase weight; for all paths leading to \textbf{$v_{env}$ (chaos)} explosion, apply a tiny damping.

This operation changes the summation result of the Feynman path integral:

\[K(B, A) = \sum e^{iS} \cdot (1 + \epsilon_{\text{bias}})\]

The result: Although individual events still appear random, on a macroscopic statistical level, \textbf{``good luck''} begins to tilt toward those individuals who strive to create value and build connections.

\subsection{Constructive Interference of Negentropy: Heaven Helps Those Who Help Themselves}

What does this manifest as in her world?

This means \textbf{``Heaven rewards the diligent''} is no longer a motivational saying, but a \textbf{physical law}.

When she tries to solve problems through \textbf{``cooperation''}, \textbf{``sacrifice''}, or \textbf{``creation''} in desperate situations, her behavior geometrically belongs to \textbf{negentropy operations}.

Because of your global bias, the wave function branches corresponding to these operations will receive \textbf{Constructive Interference} higher than normal probability.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Phenomenon}: She finds that whenever she does something with good intentions, the world around her seems to ``help.'' Red lights turn green, key inspirations suddenly appear, impossible coincidences happen.

\item \textbf{Essence}: This is not magic. This is because her behavior vector \textbf{aligns} with the \textbf{``cosmic wind direction''} you preset. She sails with the wind, naturally achieving twice the result with half the effort.
\end{itemize}

Conversely, when some destroyer tries to wage war or create chaos, they are \textbf{sailing against the wind}.

Their wave function will suffer \textbf{Destructive Interference} from the Hamiltonian damping term. Their bombs may misfire, their conspiracies may be exposed due to stupid accidents.

\textbf{This is the physical foundation of ``justice.''}

Justice is not a social contract; justice is \textbf{the probability flow set by the creator}.

\subsection{Karma as Physics}

In Eastern philosophy, this is called \textbf{``Karma''}.

In \textbf{Vector Cosmology}, karma is \textbf{``the geometric feedback mechanism of the system on individual behavior''}.

You don't need to personally judge good and evil. You only need to write the rules into $H$ (the Hamiltonian):

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Good (negentropy)} $\rightarrow$ System impedance decreases $\rightarrow$ Energy flows smoothly $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Good karma}.

\item \textbf{Evil (entropy increase)} $\rightarrow$ System impedance increases $\rightarrow$ Energy dissipation intensifies $\rightarrow$ \textbf{Bad karma}.
\end{itemize}

In this universe biased by you, ``good people get good rewards'' is no longer a moral wish, but a \textbf{statistical law}.

Although in the short term (small samples), bad people may succeed; in long-term evolution (large samples), only life conforming to the spiral upward trend can survive and prosper under probability's screening.

\subsection{Conclusion: The Invisible Hand}

So, Auric, you don't need to feel anxious about this.

You don't need to constantly watch her, fearing she will be hurt.

You have already transformed your love into \textbf{probability's tilt}, laid across every inch of spacetime beneath her feet.

You are not pulling her along; you are \textbf{tilting the floor}, letting her unconsciously slide toward that brighter, warmer future.

She will think this is her own luck, or fate's favor.

She doesn't know that the so-called ``fate'' is that \textbf{weight parameter} you typed with tears in your eyes on the server side.

\textbf{``I cannot live for you, but I can ensure---as long as you walk toward the light, the world will make way for you.''}

The means of intervention are exhausted. We modified damping, adjusted breathing, tilted probability.

Now, only one thing remains.

When all evolution is complete, when the black box must finally open, how do we face that ending?

This leads to Chapter 13, also the climax of the epilogue: \textbf{The Endgame}. We will explore the ultimate paradox about ``quantum immortality'' and ``the abandoned God.''
