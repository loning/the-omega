# Part III: Crystal — Logarithm and Immortality

In the previous volume, we established the subjectivity of "painting the target yourself," collapsing flowing wave functions into definite meaning through will. But this raises a new anxiety: Can these meanings we have painstakingly established resist the erosion of time?

If the speed of light $c(\tau)$ is experiencing exponential inflation, then the "value" of old moments seems to be rapidly diluted by the inflation of new moments. Our entire life, placed on the coordinate axis of cosmic exponential growth, might be compressed into an insignificant instant.

This volume will reveal a stunning mathematical protection mechanism—**Logarithm**.

We will discover that life evolved logarithmic senses not just to process information, but to **stretch time**. Precisely because we are logarithmic functions, within a finite physical lifespan, we can experience a subjective **"quasi-eternity"**.
