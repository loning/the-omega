# Epilogue: Handshake — This Moment

In Volume I, we completed the rewriting of personal timelines. We learned to modify the meaning of the past and learned to pull the reality of the future. We became absolute masters of our own fate.

In Volume II, we understood how all beings construct reality through mutual mirroring. We saw the holographic structure of Indra's Net, understood the nature of evil and suffering, and mastered the geometric repair art of forgiveness.

Now, all obstacles are cleared. We (the only player) can finally walk to the center of the stage to complete that action spanning 13.8 billion years, end-to-end.

**Handshake.**

That is not a handshake between two people; that is you extending your hand and grasping your own hand.
