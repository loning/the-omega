# 6.1 Geometry is Indestructible

> "Do you think your first kiss has disappeared? Do you think Qin Shi Huang's army has disappeared? No. In the geometric body of four-dimensional spacetime, they are permanently sealed at their respective coordinate points, like insects in amber. Although the stylus has moved away, this does not mean the grooves on the record have been erased."

## Collapse is Minting

In Volume One, we defined time as "transaction": exchanging $v_{ext}$ degrees of freedom for $v_{int}$ certainty. Now, we examine this process from a geometric perspective.

When an observer makes an observation (or makes a choice), the wave function collapses.

In Hilbert space, this manifests as a rotating vector suddenly **locking** onto a specific basis.

$$|\Psi_{fluid}\rangle \xrightarrow{\text{Collapse}} |\Psi_{solid}\rangle$$

This locking process is **"the hardening of geometric structure"**.

* Before collapse, events are probabilistic ripples; they are soft.

* After collapse, events are definite history; they are hard.

Every moment that "has happened" becomes an indelible **Phase Signature** in the universe's overall wave function.

Like carving words on a clay tablet. When you write, the clay is soft (present); when you finish, the clay dries (past).

**The passage of time is the process of this cosmic clay tablet constantly drying and hardening.**

## The Hardness of History

This explains why we cannot change the past.

Not because some mysterious time police forbid us from traveling, but because **the geometric entropy of the past has approached zero**.

To change the past (such as killing your grandfather), you need to "melt" the already "crystallized" complex geometric structure back into a flowing superposition state.

This requires inputting reverse $c_{FS}$ energy, approximately equal to the total energy consumed when creating that history, plus the additional computational power needed to resist the entire universe's entanglement network.

**Changing the past is not physically impossible, but economically "infinitely expensive."**

Therefore, the past is safe.

Everything you have experienced—your pain, your glory, your lover's face—has been cast by physical laws into an indestructible monument.

It stands at the coordinate $t_{past}$, and no force can erase it.
