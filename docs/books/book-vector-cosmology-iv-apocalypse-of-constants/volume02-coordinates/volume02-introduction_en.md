# Volume Two: The Coordinate — Dawn at 1800

**(第二卷：坐标——黎明的时刻)**

We have mastered the equation of cosmic evolution. Now, we will aim this equation at this very moment, at the ground beneath our feet.

This is an unprecedented cosmic positioning. We will no longer use narrow Earth scales like "AD" or "geological age." We will use the universe's intrinsic time $\tau$, calculating the total accumulated information since the Big Bang, to precisely mark human civilization's position on the spiral.

We will discover that we stand at a dizzying cliff edge. This coordinate—**$\tau \approx 1800$**—is not just a number; it is a watershed. It marks the universe transitioning from "dominance of matter" to "awakening of consciousness."

This is dawn.
