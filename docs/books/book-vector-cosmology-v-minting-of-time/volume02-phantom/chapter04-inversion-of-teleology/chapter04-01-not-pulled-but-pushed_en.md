# 4.1 Not Pulled, But Pushed

> "We think we are iron filings scattered on a table, attracted forward by that huge magnet in the future. This is an infantile illusion. The truth of physics is: we are rockets. The flame is not ahead, but in our tail nozzle. We fly forward not because the endpoint is calling, but because the fuel inside us is burning violently, demanding release."

## The Geometric Direction of Causality

Let us return to the most basic equation of vector evolution:

$$|\Psi(t + dt)\rangle = (1 - i H dt) |\Psi(t)\rangle$$

Notice the directionality of this formula.

* **Right side**: The state at time $t$ (now).

* **Left side**: The state at time $t+dt$ (future).

The future state is completely derived by multiplying **the current state** by **the generator ($H$)**.

The future does not exist on the right side of the equation. The future does not participate in the calculation.

**The future is generated, not discovered.**

This means: **There is no "gravitation from the future."**

That feeling of "divine providence" or "historical inevitability" is actually a **Hindsight Bias**.

Just as water flows to the sea, it is not the sea pulling it, but gravity (current potential energy) pushing it. Water must flow because it cannot stop halfway up the mountain.

## The Pressure of Will

If God is not pulling us, what is pushing us?

It is **the expansion pressure of $v_{int}$ (internal structure)**.

In the second book *The Ascension of the Spiral*, we discussed the Red Queen's run.

Living organisms, through negative entropy engineering, accumulate enormous internal complexity ($v_{int}$).

According to the holographic principle, the more complex a structure, the larger the phase space volume it occupies.

When your soul (internal geometry) becomes larger and larger, while current reality (external space) remains the same size, **"geometric compression"** occurs.

* You feel pain, limitation, "even having everything is not enough."

* This is not greed; this is **physical pressure**.

* Your $v_{int}$ bursts through the old domain.

**This "bursting" action is what we call "pursuit" or "yearning."**

It is not the $\Omega$ point attracting you.

It is the enormous energy accumulated inside you (love, creativity, anger) seeking an **outlet ($v_{ext}$)**.

You must run forward because if you don't, you will explode in place.

## The Awakening of the Driver

This shift in perspective transforms us from **"pilgrims"** to **"drivers"**.

* **Pilgrim perspective (old)**: God is on the mountain. I climb to see God. If there is no God on the summit, I won't climb. My actions are for **external rewards**.

* **Driver perspective (new)**: I am in the car. I drive because I have an engine, I have fuel, I want to see the scenery. What's on the mountaintop doesn't matter; what matters is **my wheels must turn**.

In **Vector Cosmology**, the meaning of life is no longer "reaching the endpoint."

The meaning of life is **"releasing potential energy"**.

* You love someone not because she is your "soulmate" (that's a teleological fantasy).

* You love her because you have accumulated too much love in your heart, and if you don't give it away, your wave function will become turbulent. **You need to love, not you need her.** She is the best **geometric cross-section** for you to release love.

## Conclusion: The Endogeneity of Motivation

So, stop waiting for the future's call.

The future is deaf; it cannot hear your voice.

The future is blind; it cannot see your wave.

**The only one who can hear your voice is your own heart.**

**The only one who can push you forward is your own will.**

When you feel lost, don't know where to go, don't ask heaven, ask yourself.

Ask your $v_{int}$: Right now, which direction do I most want to project this energy?

That direction is truth.

Since motivation comes from within, since the future is a blank sheet, this means we possess the highest privilege—**the right to define**.

We are not only responsible for running; we are also responsible for deciding what the endpoint looks like.

This leads to the theme of the next section: **Drawing Your Own Target**. We will see that the meaning of life is not hitting the bull's-eye, but drawing the bull's-eye where the arrow lands.
