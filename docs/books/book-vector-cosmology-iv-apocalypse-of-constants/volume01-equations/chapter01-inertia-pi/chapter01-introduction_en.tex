\section{Volume One: The Equation --- Gears of the Seasons}

The evolution of the universe is not a chaotic random walk, but a precisely operating machine. It is like a giant mechanical watch, with four fundamental gears meshing inside. Each gear is cast from a mathematical constant, each representing an ultimate physical will.

In this volume, we will disassemble this machine and examine these four knights one by one: \textbf{Inertia ($\pi$)}, \textbf{Ambition ($\phi$)}, \textbf{Engine ($e$)}, and \textbf{Result ($c$)}.

The first we must face is the oldest, heaviest, and most loyal watchman.
