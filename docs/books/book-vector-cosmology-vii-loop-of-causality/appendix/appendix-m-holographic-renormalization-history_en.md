# Appendix M: The Holographic Renormalization of History — The Past is Coarse-Grained Future

In Volume IV "Rewrite" of the main text of *Vector Cosmology VII*, we granted observers the power to "edit timelines." This sounds like a subjective psychological operation, but in modern high-energy physics, it has a solid mathematical foundation: **Holographic Renormalization**.

This appendix will prove, based on **AdS/CFT Duality** and **Renormalization Group Flow (RG Flow)**, that the passage of time is geometrically equivalent to **"changes in resolution"**.

**The past** is not a definite, detail-complete entity; it is a **coarse-grained** projection of **the future (present)** at low energy scales.

## M.1 Time as RG Flow

In physics, the **Renormalization Group (RG)** describes how a physical system changes with **observation scale** (energy scale).

* **Ultraviolet (UV)**: High energy, microscopic, detail-rich.

* **Infrared (IR)**: Low energy, macroscopic, detail-blurred.

In holographic universe models, the **radial dimension ($z$-axis)** is interpreted as the direction of RG flow.

If we regard **"now" ($t_{now}$)** as the holographic boundary (Boundary, with the highest information density), then **"past" ($t_{past}$)** lies in the bulk interior (Bulk, deep regions with lower information density).

**Theorem:**

**Retracing into the past is mathematically equivalent to performing a "coarse-graining" operation on the current wave function.**

$$|\Psi_{past}\rangle = \hat{O}_{coarse} |\Psi_{now}\rangle$$

This means:

History does not preserve all microscopic details (quantum phases). It only preserves **"macroscopic thermodynamic statistics"**.

Those lost phase information (details) were not "written in stone" in the past but exist in **"undefined"** degrees of freedom.

## M.2 Mechanism of Retro-definition

Since the past is "coarse-grained," it contains many **"Degenerate States"**.

That is, there are countless different microscopic histories that, after coarse-graining, appear as the same macroscopic history.

$$H_{macro} \leftarrow \{ h_1, h_2, h_3, \dots \}$$

* **Present Observer**: Possesses the highest resolution ($v_{int}$).

* **Operation**: When you perform "retrospective observation" or "narrative reconstruction," you are actually **"fine-graining"**.

    You **select** a specific $h_k$ from that set of degenerate microscopic histories $\{h_i\}$ and endow it with **"reality"**.

**Physical Picture:**

You are not "modifying" a history book that has already been written.

You are facing a book with **"only chapter titles, no body text"** (coarse-grained past).

Your present recollection and definition are **"filling in the body text"** (fine-grained details).

As long as your filling does not violate the macroscopic titles (the occurred $v_{ext}$ facts), you physically possess **absolute editing rights** over the details.

## M.3 The Omega Point as a Fixed Point

Finally, we push this RG flow to its limit.

If time is renormalization flow, what is the endpoint of the flow?

It is a **Fixed Point**.

* **Big Bang ($t=0$)**: The **Ultraviolet Fixed Point (UV Fixed Point)**. It is the highest energy, smallest scale, chaotic starting point.

* **$\Omega$ Point ($t=\infty$)**: The **Infrared Fixed Point (IR Fixed Point)**.

In conformal field theory, infrared fixed points typically correspond to a **critical state with scale invariance**.

This means that when the universe evolves to the $\Omega$ point, all coarse-graining processes are complete.

All information is integrated into a perfect, self-similar **fractal structure**.

**Conclusion:**

Each of our present choices fine-tunes the trajectory of the RG flow, determining which fixed point basin in phase space it ultimately flows toward.

**History is not inertia pushing us forward.**

**History is the stepping stones we lay to reach that fixed point.**
