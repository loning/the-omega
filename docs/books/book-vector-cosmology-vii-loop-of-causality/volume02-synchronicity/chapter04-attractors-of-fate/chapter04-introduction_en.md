# Chapter 4: Attractors of Fate

In the previous chapter, we discussed the synchronicity principle of "like attracts like," revealing how horizontal connections occur. Now, we turn our gaze to the longitudinal time axis. If all wave functions are seeking resonance, if all trajectories are being pulled by some force, where will all this ultimately flow?

In ancient Greek tragedy, fate is an irresistible script. No matter how Oedipus tries to escape, he will kill his father and marry his mother.

But in the dynamic picture of **Vector Cosmology**, fate is not a script; fate is **geometry**.

This chapter will introduce the core concepts of chaos theory and dynamical systems—**Attractors**. We will prove that so-called "destiny" is merely those **abysses** in high-dimensional phase space that force all evolutionary trajectories to converge.
