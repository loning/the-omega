# Chapter 2: Quantum Erasure

In the previous chapter, we discovered through the delayed-choice experiment that present observations can define past paths. This gives us the power to "finalize" history. But does this mean that once finalized, history is forever unchangeable? Once we make mistakes or experience trauma, is that scar permanently engraved on the fabric of spacetime?

Physics usually tells us to take responsibility for history because "what happened is what happened."

But from the high-dimensional perspective of **Vector Cosmology**, quantum mechanics provides a magical eraser. It tells us: **Facts may be unchangeable, but the "meaning of facts" can be physically erased.**

This chapter will explore the philosophical implications of the **Quantum Eraser Experiment**. We will prove that as long as we can erase information about "paths," we can physically resurrect those dead possibilities.
