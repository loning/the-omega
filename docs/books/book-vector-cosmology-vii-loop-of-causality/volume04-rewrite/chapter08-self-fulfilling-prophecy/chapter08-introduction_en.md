# Chapter 8: Self-Fulfilling Prophecy

In the previous chapter, we explored how to reconstruct the past through "definition" and "pruning." This gives us editing rights over history. Now, we turn our gaze to the other end of the time axis—**the future**.

In classical physics, predicting the future is a passive task. We collect present data, substitute into equations, and calculate tomorrow's results. If the results are not ideal, we can only accept them.

But in the participatory universe of **Vector Cosmology**, prediction is not calculation; prediction is **"construction"**.

This chapter will reveal the physical mechanism of **Self-Fulfilling Prophecy**. We will prove that **Confidence** is not an ethereal psychological state; it is high-density **geometric computational power**. When you are extremely certain about a future, you are actually placing a **"gravitational anchor"** at that yet-to-occur spacetime coordinate, forcibly pulling reality toward you.
