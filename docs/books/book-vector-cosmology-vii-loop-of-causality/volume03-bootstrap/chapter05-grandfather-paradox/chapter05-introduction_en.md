# Chapter 5: Solution to the Grandfather Paradox

In Volume I, we explored the possibility of retro-causality; in Volume II, we saw acausal connections through synchronicity. Now, we must face the most famous and most troubling logical bomb in time travel theory—**The Grandfather Paradox**.

If present you can really influence the past through "aspiration" or "observation," can you go back and kill your grandfather? If you kill him, you won't be born; if you weren't born, you can't go back to kill him. This is a classic logical dead loop.

In the closed-loop geometry of **Vector Cosmology**, this paradox does not exist. Because the universe is not only quantum but also **Self-Consistent**.

This chapter will introduce the **Novikov Self-Consistency Principle** and upgrade it to a topological axiom of **FS geometry**. We will see how physical laws block paradoxes like a blast shield by distorting probabilities.
