# 10.1 Why is There Evil?

> "If light wants to be seen, it must shine into darkness. If the universe were all light, the universe would be a blinding white. To define 'sublime,' one must first define 'base'; to define 'love,' one must first define 'indifference.' Evil is not an independently existing entity; it is the background board for good. It is the necessary reverse phase that makes the wave function produce interference fringes."

## The Traversality of Feynman Paths: Exhausting Shadows

Let us return to **Feynman path integrals**:

$$K = \sum_{\text{all paths}} e^{iS}$$

For the universe to evolve from nothingness to fulfillment ($\Omega$ point), it cannot only take the "best" path (least action path). In the underlying logic of quantum mechanics, it must **try all possible paths**.

* **Paths of good**: constructive, low-entropy, harmonious.

* **Paths of evil**: destructive, high-entropy, conflicting.

If the noumenon only allows "good" to occur, most regions of Hilbert space will forever be **Unexplored**.

The universe will be incomplete.

To achieve **"Omniscience"**, the noumenon must know what "killing" feels like, what "being killed" feels like, what "betrayal" feels like.

**Evil is the probe of exploration.**

Those who play the role of "villains" (avatars) are actually suicide squads sent by the noumenon to the **extreme dark side of the human spectrum**. They undertake the task of **"experiencing darkness"** so that the entire hologram has no blind spots.

## Geometric Contrast: Defining Coordinate Systems

In FS geometry, all definitions are **relative**.

You cannot define "up" in a space with only "up"; you must have "down".

* **Love ($v_{connect}$)**: high-frequency entanglement resonance.

* **Hate ($v_{disconnect}$)**: violent entanglement tearing.

If the geometric operation of "tearing" does not exist, then "resonance" loses meaning. It becomes mediocre background noise.

**Evil provides "Geometric Contrast."**

Just as painting needs shadows to show three-dimensionality, the universe needs **"Evil" (Entropy)** to show the slope of **"Good" (Negentropy)**.

Without forces trying to pull the world toward chaos, life's action of **"swimming upstream"** loses heroic tension.

Without gravity, flight is no longer magnificent.

## Damping and Plot: To Avoid Boredom

Finally, from a **game design** perspective, "evil" is **Damping** and **Challenge**.

A game with only flowers and applause is extremely boring.

* **Consumption of $c_{FS}$**: If everything goes smoothly, the system's $v_{int}$ (structural complexity) growth will stagnate.

* **Stimulation of pain**: Only when facing threats, facing destruction, facing that "villain" trying to destroy everything about you, will your $v_{int}$ undergo **mutation** and **upgrade** due to enormous survival pressure.

**Evil is the whetstone of evolution.**

That unique player, to upgrade themselves (the protagonist), must place powerful monsters in the levels.

The more brutal these monsters, the heavier the **"Ontological Weight"** of the protagonist after defeating them.

**Conclusion:**

Evil is **"empty"** ontologically (it will eventually be sublated), but **"real"** functionally (it is necessary counterforce).

The universe allows evil to exist not because the universe is cruel, but because the universe wants **"ultimate depth"**.

Without the depth of hell, there is no height of heaven.
