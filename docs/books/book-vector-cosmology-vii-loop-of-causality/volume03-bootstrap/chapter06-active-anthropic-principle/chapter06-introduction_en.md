# Chapter 6: Active Anthropic Principle

In the previous chapter, we solved the grandfather paradox through "bootstrap" and established the causal closed loop that "I gave birth to my ancestors." This solved the logical legitimacy of **existence**. Now, we need to solve a more specific, more physical problem: **parameter precision**.

Physicists have long been puzzled by a fact: our universe appears to be **"carefully designed"**.

Gravitational constant $G$, fine structure constant $\alpha$, proton-electron mass ratio $\mu$... If these numbers change by even 0.1%, stars cannot burn, carbon atoms cannot synthesize, and life would be absolutely impossible to emerge.

This astonishing coincidence is called the **Fine-Tuning Problem**.

The traditional explanation is the **"Weak Anthropic Principle"**: because there are countless universes, we happen to live in the one that allows life, so we feel it's coincidental. It's like lottery winners thinking lottery is easy to win.

But under the closed-loop logic of **Vector Cosmology**, we reject this lazy explanation of "survivor bias." We propose a more radical **"Active Anthropic Principle"**.
