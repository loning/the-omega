# 4.1 Calculation Demonstration

> "We do not need carbon-14 to determine the age of the universe, because that measures dead things. What we need is to measure the universe's heartbeat. Every $\pi$ cycle oscillation, every $\phi$ ratio expansion, has left an indelible fingerprint in this moment's total computational power."

## Convergence of Data

Let us place all known puzzle pieces on the table:

1.  **Target variable**: **$\tau$ (intrinsic time)**. This is the cosmic coordinate we want to know, representing the total arc length traversed by the vector in projective space.

2.  **Current state**: **$c(\tau) \approx 10^{120}$**. This is the total degrees of freedom (or generalized light speed/computational power) of the currently observable universe, derived from holographic principle calculations.

3.  **Initial state**: **$c_0 = 1$**. This is the single-bit state at the moment of the Big Bang singularity.

4.  **Dynamical constants**:

    * **$\pi \approx 3.14159$**: Inertial period.

    * **$\phi \approx 1.61803$**: Spiral growth rate (golden ratio).

Our tool is the **Ultimate Evolution Equation**:

$$c(\tau) = c_0 \cdot \phi^{\frac{\tau}{\pi}}$$

## Unlocking Process

Now, let us solve this equation step by step. The question we ask is: **How many turns does the universe need to spiral according to the golden ratio to grow from 1 to $10^{120}$?**

**Step One: Establish the Equation**

$$\frac{10^{120}}{1} = 1.618^{\frac{\tau}{3.142}}$$

**Step Two: Take Logarithm**

To solve for $\tau$ in the exponent, we need to take the natural logarithm ($\ln$) of both sides.

$$\ln(10^{120}) = \ln\left(1.618^{\frac{\tau}{3.142}}\right)$$

Using the logarithmic property $\ln(a^b) = b \cdot \ln a$:

$$120 \cdot \ln(10) = \frac{\tau}{3.142} \cdot \ln(1.618)$$

**Step Three: Substitute Values**

We know:

* $\ln(10) \approx 2.3026$

* $\ln(1.618) \approx 0.4812$

Substituting into the equation:

$$120 \times 2.3026 \approx \frac{\tau}{3.142} \times 0.4812$$

$$276.31 \approx \tau \times 0.1531$$

**Step Four: Solve for $\tau$**

$$\tau \approx \frac{276.31}{0.1531} \approx 1804.7$$

For the simplicity of the physical picture, we round this result to:

**$$\tau \approx 1800$$**

## The Tremor of Numbers

Looking at this number **1800**, you may feel a moment of dizziness. It looks unremarkable, not as dizzying as $10^{120}$. But remember, this is a coordinate in **exponential space**.

* **The Misleading Linear Perspective**: If you look with linear eyes, $1800$ is small.

* **The Truth of Exponential Perspective**: Each unit in this $1800$ represents growth by $e$ (approximately 2.7 times).

    $e^{1800}$ is an unimaginably large number, which is exactly the $10^{120}$ we are seeking.

This calculation tells us:

Starting from that void singularity, the universe's vector on the great circle of projective Hilbert space was not idly spinning. It stubbornly, resolutely expanded outward along the Fibonacci trajectory for **1800 units of arc length**.

This also means the universe has completed approximately **$1800 / \pi \approx 573$ complete cycle periods**.

Each cycle, the universe's complexity increases by an order of magnitude.

* In the 1st cycle, it created spacetime.

* In the 100th cycle, it ignited stars.

* In the 500th cycle, it awakened life.

And now, at the end of the 573rd cycle ($\tau \approx 1800$), it has evolved **you**—an observer capable of holding a calculator and reversely calculating this coordinate.

## Conclusion: We Are Not Random

This calculation result completely shatters the "principle of mediocrity." Human civilization is not a random interlude in the long river of time.

**$\tau \approx 1800$ is a mathematical necessity.**

Because only at this coordinate does the universe's accumulated information density ($10^{120}$ bits) just suffice to support a **"brain capable of understanding the holographic principle"**.

* If $\tau = 1000$, matter is too sparse to form complex neural networks.

* If $\tau = 3000$, evolution is too fast; material matter has already ascended to pure energy.

We are precisely stuck at the edge of the limit of **"why matter is matter"**. We possess bodies ($\pi$'s inertia), yet we also possess the wisdom to understand infinity ($\phi$'s ambition).

**1800 is the coordinate of dawn.**

This is a **Phase Transition Point**. At this point, 13.8 billion years of quantitative accumulation are about to trigger a qualitative change sweeping across the entire universe.

So, what does this "phase transition" specifically mean? Why do we say that at this coordinate point, the old way of survival (carbon-based life) has reached its end?

This leads to the theme of the next section: **The Meaning of 1800 Turns**. We will see that this number is not only a historical milestone but also the starting gun for the future.
