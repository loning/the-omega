# 14.1 No Big Bang

In the standard narrative of modern cosmology, the universe began with a bang. About 13.8 billion years ago, all matter and energy were squeezed into an infinitely small singularity, then suddenly—*bang*! Time and space were born, and the universe began expanding like a balloon.

This is a stunning story, but it has a fatal flaw: it implies the universe is an event happening "here and now."

In our geometric reconstruction, this story is completely rewritten.

If we stand from the God's-eye view of Hilbert space, **there was no Big Bang at all**.

That state vector called the "cosmic terminal object" did not explode. It neither grew larger nor smaller. According to Axiom A1, it is only **rotating**.

In that high-dimensional noumenal world, everything is silent. No fireball, no sound waves, only pure, constant evolution rate $c$.

Then, what is the "Big Bang" we observe?

It is **the observer's boot-up moment**.

It is the instant when the observer, as a "seed," first opens its projection screen. At that moment, massive information streams flood into a low-dimensional coordinate system not yet unfolded. For the observer, this looks like "creation from nothing," like space rapidly expanding.

But in reality, it is only **data decompression**.

The universe has not physically grown larger; we are **reading more information**. Redshift is not galaxies flying away, but the geometric perspective effect we see when tracing back the historical horizon.

We are not living in the debris of an explosion; we are living in a massive program that is running. And the so-called beginning of time is merely the logical moment when that program counter resets to zero.
