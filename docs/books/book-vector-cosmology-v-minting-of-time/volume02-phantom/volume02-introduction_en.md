# Part II: Phantom — The Truth of Omega

We have mastered the art of minting time, learned how to condense momentary transactions into eternal gold coins. But this raises an ultimate teleological question: What are we minting these coins for? Where are we heading with this heavy history?

In religion and classical philosophy, this endpoint is called **"God"**, **"Heaven"**, or **"Omega Point" ($\Omega$ Point)**. It is depicted as a real sanctuary at the end of time, where all questions have answers and all suffering is compensated.

But under the cold gaze of **Vector Cosmology**, this endpoint is a **geometric phantom**.

This volume will reveal that the gravitational source pulling us upward does not actually exist. God is not the gatekeeper at the terminal; God is the **holographic virtual image** we project into the void to make ourselves run.
