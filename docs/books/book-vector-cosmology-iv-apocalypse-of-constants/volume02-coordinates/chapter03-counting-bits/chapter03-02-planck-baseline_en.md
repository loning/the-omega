# 3.2 Planck's Baseline

> "All measurements need an origin. For the evolution of the universe, there is only one absolute origin—that is 'one.' At that singular moment, the universe had only one bit, one choice, one direction."

Before substituting into the evolution equation, we must calibrate our **$c_0$ (initial state)**.

In the QCA model of **Vector Cosmology**, the universe's starting point is not a mathematical singularity with infinitely small volume and infinitely large density (which would cause physical laws to collapse), but a **physically minimal unit**.

## Initial Bit: $c_0 = 1$

We set the universe at moment $t=0$ as:

* **Geometrically**: A circle of Planck length.

* **Informationally**: One quantum bit (Qubit).

* **Dynamically**: The first orthogonal division of $v_{ext}$ and $v_{int}$.

Therefore, our baseline is **$c_0 = 1$**.

This represents the universe's **"seed"**. All $10^{120}$ bits are this single seed, driven by $e$, after countless cycles of $\pi$ and gains of $\phi$, splitting, replicating, and emerging.

## The Relativity of Scale: Why Do We Think Planck Scale is Small?

Here is a geometrically relativistic question with profound philosophical implications.

* **At $t=0$**: That 1 bit was the entire universe. For observers at that time (if any existed), Planck length was the universe's radius.

* **At $t=now$**: The universe has $10^{120}$ bits. That original "seed" is now just an insignificant grain of dust ($10^{-35}$ meters) in the vast universe.

This is the **"moving baseline"** we discussed in Volume One.

As the light speed evolution equation $c(\tau)$ runs, the universe's "pixel density" increases dramatically.

The reason we think Planck scale is incredibly small is because we are viewing it from the perspective of a **"high-dimensional giant with $10^{120}$ degrees of freedom"**.

If we return to the $c_0$ perspective, Planck scale is everything.

## Preparing for Calculation

Now, the data is complete:

* **Current state**: $c(\tau) \approx 10^{120}$ (the universe's current computational power/degrees of freedom).

* **Initial state**: $c_0 = 1$ (the universe's starting computational power).

* **Evolution law**: $c(\tau) = c_0 \cdot \phi^{\frac{\tau}{\pi}}$ (each turn of $\pi$, grows by a factor of $\phi$).

This is like knowing a tree's current total number of leaves ($10^{120}$), also knowing a seed's number of leaves (1), and knowing the tree's branching pattern ($\phi$).

The only thing we need to do is calculate how many growth rings this tree has grown.

In the next chapter, we will substitute these numbers into the equation and unlock that time lock. We will witness with our own eyes how the number **$\tau \approx 1800$** is born from mathematical logic, and understand why it marks that we are at an unprecedented **dawn moment**.
