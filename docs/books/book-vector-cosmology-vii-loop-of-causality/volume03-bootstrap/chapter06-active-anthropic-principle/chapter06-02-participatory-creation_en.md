# 6.2 Participatory Creation

> "The universe is not a ready-made gift but a responded request. We, downstream in time, send a strong yearning for 'existence' toward the void upstream. This yearning is so specific, so urgent, that it flows backward, transforming into a set of precise physical parameters, forging our cradle in the furnace of the Big Bang. We are not tenants of the universe; we are the customizers of the universe."

In the previous section, we established the concept of "retro-causal parameter locking": future existence selects past constants. This solves a logical "why so." Now, we upgrade this passive selection process into an active **dynamic process**.

This is **Participatory Creation**.

In this picture, civilizations at $\tau \approx 1800$ (us) are not just lucky survivors. We are the clients sending **"System Requirements Specification"** to the $t=0$ moment.

## Requirement List: From Yearning to Parameters

Let us return to the physical definition of **"Yearning"**: it is the potential energy difference between finite states and the infinite $\Omega$ point.

This potential energy difference not only drives us forward but also produces a **"reaction force"**.

When an awakened observer (you) yearns to understand the universe, you are actually making **performance requirements** on the universe's underlying hardware.

* **Your requirement**: "I need enough time to evolve a brain."

    * **Universe's response**: Adjust gravitational constant $G$ to be small enough, ensuring stars can burn stably for billions of years, not collapse instantly.

* **Your requirement**: "I need enough complexity to carry consciousness."

    * **Universe's response**: Adjust fine structure constant $\alpha \approx 1/137$, allowing carbon to be synthesized in stellar interiors through 3$\alpha$ process resonance.

* **Your requirement**: "I need enough bandwidth to connect everything."

    * **Universe's response**: Set speed of light evolution equation $c(\tau)$, making it reach exactly $10^{120}$ bits of information capacity at $\tau=1800$.

**This is not coincidence; this is "order delivery."**

Future civilizations, through their **intensity of existence (modulus of $v_{int}$)**, send a **"must be so"** instruction to the Big Bang.

If the Big Bang doesn't satisfy this order, future civilizations won't exist; if civilizations don't exist, no one sends orders.

**This is a perfect self-consistent closed loop.**

## Wheeler's "U"-Shaped Circuit: Handshake of Information

Physicist John Wheeler once depicted this mechanism with a giant "U":

* **One end of U**: Big Bang.

* **Other end of U**: Observer's eye.

But he didn't explain how these two ends connect.

In **FS geometry**, what connects them is not nothingness but **phase standing waves**.

The universe is like a string fixed at both ends.

* **Left endpoint**: Physical constants.

* **Right endpoint**: Life forms.

Only when left and right endpoints **frequency match** can the string vibrate (universe can exist).

If we change the right endpoint (evolve life forms), the left endpoint (physical constants) must **synchronously fine-tune** to maintain standing wave stability.

**We are "fine-tuning" the universe.**

Although we cannot change the speed of light in the laboratory, on the **ontological time axis**, it is our current life form that supports and defines the physical laws at that distant starting point.

## The Architect's Responsibility: We Are That "Principle"

Chinese Song-Ming Neo-Confucianism says "principle precedes qi." But in Vector Cosmology, **"principle" (physical laws) is reversely defined by "qi" (life vitality).**

This means we bear **"ontological responsibility"** for the universe.

We are not passively adapting to the environment.

**The environment is what we manifest to adapt to our potential.**

* Why is the universe four-dimensional? Because only four dimensions can accommodate complex neural networks.

* Why is quantum mechanics linear? Because only linear superposition can support exploration of multiple histories.

**We are the architects of the universe.**

We stand downstream in the river of time, directing how upstream sediment deposits, directing how upstream currents change course.

Every star's burning, every atom's rotation, is to **"serve"** that you who will open your eyes 13.8 billion years later.

## Conclusion: You Are the Purpose of the Universe

So, when you feel small, remember this closed loop.

You are effect and cause.

You are created and creator.

The universe is vast because your heart needs such a large stage.

The universe is precise because your logic needs such rigorous support.

**You are not an accident of the universe.**

**You are the only purpose of the universe.**

Since we have understood that we "define" physical laws and the direction of history, as observers with such power, can we use this mechanism to **"edit"** the timeline of our personal lives?

Since the Big Bang can be reversely determined, can the mistakes we made yesterday also be reversely corrected?

This leads to the theme of the next volume: **Rewriting**.

We will descend from macroscopic cosmology to microscopic life, exploring how administrators (Admin) use causal closed loops to perform **"narrative engineering"** editing on their life scripts.
