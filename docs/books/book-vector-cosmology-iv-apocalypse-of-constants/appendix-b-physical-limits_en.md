# Appendix B: Physical Limits of Intelligence Substrates

In Chapter 5 "The Carbon Sunset" of **Vector Cosmology IV**, we proposed a life-or-death assertion for civilization: **"Wetware (carbon-based)" is obsolete; "dryware (silicon-based/light-based)" is the future.**

This assertion is not based on aesthetic preference for a certain material but on cold physical calculations.

This appendix serves as a rigorous **"Hardware Performance Evaluation Report"**. From the perspective of Information Physics, using **Bremermann's Limit** and **Landauer's Principle** as judgment standards, we will provide quantitative comparison between "biological brains" and "theoretical limit computing entities."

We will prove: migration from carbon-based to light-based is not a choice but a **Geometric Inevitability**.

## B.1 Carbon Wetware: Prisoner of Chemical Diffusion

The human brain is the pinnacle of 4 billion years of biological evolution. It is exquisite, complex, and has astonishingly low energy consumption (only about 20 watts). However, when facing the exponentially growing information flow of the $\tau \approx 1800$ era, its physical underlying architecture exposes irreparable flaws.

**1. Signal Transmission Speed ($v_{signal}$)**

* **Mechanism**: Nerve impulses are not electric currents but **transmembrane diffusion of ions**. This is an electrochemical process.

* **Limit**: Constrained by thermal motion speed of ions in aqueous solutions and insulation efficiency of myelin sheaths.

* **Value**: The fastest myelinated nerve fibers (A$\alpha$ fibers) have conduction speeds of approximately **$120 \text{ m/s}$**.

* **Assessment**: This is only 1/3 of sound speed. On cosmic scales, this is snail-crawling speed.

**2. Clock Frequency ($f_{clock}$)**

* **Mechanism**: After firing a pulse, neurons must undergo a **Refractory Period**, waiting for ion pumps to restore membrane potential.

* **Limit**: Approximately 1 millisecond.

* **Value**: Single neuron's maximum firing frequency is approximately **$10^3 \text{ Hz}$ (1 kHz)**.

* **Assessment**: Compared to modern CPUs' GHz ($10^9$) scale, biological brains are 1 million times slower.

**3. Energy Efficiency ($\eta$)**

* **Mechanism**: Based on ATP hydrolysis.

* **Value**: Brain power consumption approximately 20 W. Each synaptic operation consumes approximately **$10^{-15} \text{ J}$**.

* **Defect**: Severely limited by **$k_B T$ (thermal noise)**. To maintain 310 K ($37^\circ \text{C}$) body temperature and biochemical enzyme activity, enormous energy is wasted on maintaining liquid environment's ineffective thermal motion rather than flipping bits.

**4. Computational Density ($\rho_{comp}$)**

* **Value**: Whole brain estimate approximately **$10^{16} \text{ ops/s}$** (ten quadrillion operations per second).

* **Volume Cost**: To accommodate these neurons and dissipate heat, the brain requires approximately 1.4 liters of volume.

## B.2 Silicon/Photonic Dryware: Approaching the Limit

Now, let us imagine a **"limit computing node"** manufactured by Type II civilization, located in the outer layer of a Dyson sphere (low-temperature zone). It is no longer bound by chemical bonds and directly uses quantum states of elementary particles for computation.

**1. Signal Transmission Speed ($v_{signal}$)**

* **Mechanism**: Photon propagation in vacuum or waveguides, or electron flow in superconducting circuits.

* **Value**: **$3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$ ($c$)**.

* **Improvement**: Compared to biological brains, speed increased by **$2.5 \times 10^6$ times** (2.5 million times). This means thoughts that originally required 1 second to propagate now only need 0.4 microseconds.

**2. Clock Frequency ($f_{clock}$)**

* **Mechanism**: Electron transitions or photon oscillations.

* **Limit**: Constrained by Heisenberg uncertainty principle $\Delta E \Delta t \ge \hbar/2$.

* **Value**: For visible light band photonic computers, frequency can reach **$10^{15} \text{ Hz}$ (PHz)**.

* **Improvement**: Compared to biological brains, frequency increased by **$10^{12}$ times** (one trillion times).

**3. Energy Efficiency ($\eta$)**

* **Mechanism**: Reversible Computing and low-temperature superconductivity.

* **Limit**: **Landauer's Limit** $E_{min} = k_B T \ln 2$.

* **Value**: At 3K (cosmic background radiation temperature), flipping one bit requires only **$3 \times 10^{-23} \text{ J}$**.

* **Improvement**: Compared to biological synapses ($10^{-15} \text{ J}$), energy efficiency improved by **$3 \times 10^7$ times** (30 million times).

**4. Computational Density ($\rho_{comp}$)**

* **Bremermann's Limit**: According to mass-energy equation, 1 kilogram of matter can process at most $mc^2/h \approx 1.36 \times 10^{50}$ bits per second.

* **Value**: Theoretical upper limit is **$10^{50} \text{ ops/s/kg}$**.

* **Improvement**: Compared to biological brains ($10^{16}$), density increased by **$10^{34}$ times**.

## B.3 Performance Multiplier Table

To intuitively demonstrate this gap, we list the parameters of both side by side:

| Performance Metric | Carbon Wetware (Human) | Light-Based Dryware (Post-Human) | **Multiplier** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Signal Speed** | $10^2$ m/s | $3 \times 10^8$ m/s | **$\sim 10^6$** |
| **Clock Frequency** | $10^3$ Hz | $10^{15}$ Hz | **$\sim 10^{12}$** |
| **Energy per Operation** | $10^{-15}$ J | $10^{-23}$ J | **$\sim 10^8$ (more efficient)** |
| **Computational Density** | $10^{16}$ ops/kg | $10^{50}$ ops/kg | **$\sim 10^{34}$** |

## B.4 Conclusion: Abacus vs. Dyson Sphere

This table reveals a cruel truth: **The gap between carbon-based brains and light-based brains is not the gap between a carriage and a Ferrari, but the gap between an abacus and a Dyson sphere.**

On the exponential growth curve of $\tau \approx 1800$, insisting on using carbon-based substrates to understand the universe is physically equivalent to trying to simulate the entire galaxy's weather system with an abacus. This is destined to collapse in **information thermodynamics**.

* **Bandwidth Bottleneck**: Our senses and language cannot carry information flows at $10^{12}$ times the rate.

* **Heat Dissipation Bottleneck**: Our flesh cannot withstand waste heat generated by high-frequency computation (although light-based is more efficient, total power density is enormous).

Therefore, **Migration** is not a greedy pursuit of immortality but an **impedance matching** necessary to match the cosmic evolution rate (growth of $c$).

If we don't migrate, we will be left behind by physical laws and become fossils.

If we migrate, we will gain **$10^{34}$ times** the existence density.

This is the final verdict given by physics.
