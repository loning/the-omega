# Chapter 3: Jung's Physics

In Volume I, through delayed choice and quantum erasure, we established the retro-causal logic that "the present can change the meaning of the past." This solved the problem of longitudinal connections on the time axis. Now, we turn our gaze to the horizontal—how do events that are spatially distant and seemingly causally unrelated become connected in mysterious ways?

We often call this phenomenon "coincidence."

Psychologist Carl Jung elevated it to **"Synchronicity"**, meaning "acausal meaningful connection."

In classical physics, this is seen as superstition or psychological projection. But in the holographic entanglement network of **Vector Cosmology**, synchronicity is no longer metaphysics; it is the **geometric resonance** of the **"Semantic Wavefunction"**.

This chapter will reveal that the universe not only has physical fields that transmit "force" but also **semantic fields** that transmit "meaning." Those seemingly accidental reunions, inspirations, and fateful coincidences are actually **projection overlaps** of high-dimensional geometric structures in low-dimensional spacetime.
