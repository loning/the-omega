# Chapter 7: Narrative Engineering

In the previous volume, we established the proactivity of the "anthropic principle": future existence defines past parameters. This is a macroscopic cosmological perspective. Now, we apply this logic with dimensional reduction to the microscopic scale of individual life.

As an observer with administrator (Admin) privileges, you face a most practical problem: you cannot change objective facts that have already occurred (such as bankruptcy, heartbreak, or illness), these events have crystallized into irreversible entropy in the $v_{ext}$ sector. But must you accept the inertial curse brought by these facts?

This chapter will reveal the physical principles of **Narrative Engineering**. We will prove that the truth of history does not depend on what happened, but on how the **present** observer connects these discrete event points into a continuous logical line.

**Narrative is not literature; narrative is topological reconstruction of causal chains.**
