# Appendix D: Relativistic Bound on Observer Mutual Information

This appendix derives the constraints of special relativity on observer cognitive capacity from an information-theoretic perspective.

Let observer $O$ have memory bandwidth $\mathcal{B}_{mem}^{(\tau)}$ (i.e., the maximum mutual information that can be written per unit **proper time**).

When the observer moves at velocity $v_{ext}$ relative to the external world, their proper time flow rate slows:

$$\frac{d\tau}{dt} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{v_{ext}^2}{c^2}}$$

Therefore, in **coordinate time** $t$ (the reference frame of the external world), the information the observer can process $\mathcal{B}_{mem}^{(t)}$ is constrained as follows:

$$\mathcal{B}_{mem}^{(t)} = \mathcal{B}_{mem}^{(\tau)} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v_{ext}^2}{c^2}} \quad \text{(D.1)}$$

This not only proves "the faster you move, the slower you think," but also provides a strict information-theoretic proof for "photons have no time/no consciousness" in the main text: when $v_{ext} \to c$, the information writing rate drops to zero.
