# Chapter 4: Inversion of Teleology

In the previous chapter, we exposed the universe's greatest deception: the $\Omega$ point (God/ultimate truth) is not a real physical gravitational source. It is merely a virtual image we project at infinity to overcome thermodynamic inertia.

If the future is empty, if there is no magnet ahead, then why are we still running?

What force pushes single cells to become humans? What force pushes us to write books, to love, to explore?

In traditional theology and classical philosophy (Aristotle), this is called **"Final Cause"**—that is, future goals determine present behavior.

But in the dynamics of **Vector Cosmology**, we will perform a complete **"Inversion of Teleology"**.

This chapter will reveal: **There is no force pulling us from ahead. All motivation comes from behind us, from that internal, unrepressible, outward-expanding will.**
