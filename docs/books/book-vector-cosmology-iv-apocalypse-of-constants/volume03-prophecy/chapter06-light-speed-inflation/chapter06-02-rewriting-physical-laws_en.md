# 6.2 The Rewriting of Physical Laws

> "When speed is fast enough to ignore distance, 'position' is no longer a physical quantity, but just a memory address. In the universe of $\tau = 2000$, Newton's mechanics and Einstein's relativity are not overthrown; they are 'dimensionally reduced.' They become outdated syntax in that grander holographic operating system, applicable only to low-speed subroutines."

In the previous section, we predicted that at $\tau = 2000$, effective light speed will explode by $10^{13}$ times. This means the Milky Way is causally compressed into a single quantum state with instant response capability.

This order-of-magnitude change is not merely parameter adjustment; it is **physical picture reconstruction**.

The physical laws we learn in textbooks—$F=ma$, $E=mc^2$, $G=mM/r^2$—all share a common premise: **Locality**. They assume objects must interact by traversing space, and this interaction is limited by distance.

But when light speed $c$ tends toward infinity (relative to macroscopic scales), locality fails. Physics will transform from **"the science of motion"** to **"the science of information"**.

## From Transport to Teleportation: The Abolition of $v_{ext}$

In old physics, if you want to send an apple from Earth to Mars, you need to overcome gravity, burn fuel, spend time. You are paying expensive **$v_{ext}$ (external velocity)** budget to exchange for spatial coordinate translation.

But in the high light-speed era, this kind of **"physical transport"** appears extremely primitive and inefficient.

As $c(\tau)$ grows exponentially, the cost of transmitting information (energy consumption/time) decreases exponentially relative to transporting matter. Civilization will discover a new axiom:

**"Moving atoms is foolish; moving bits is wise."**

Physical laws are rewritten as **Quantum Teleportation Protocol**:

1.  **Scan**: Read the **$v_{int}$ (internal structure)** information (quantum state) of the apple at the source point.

2.  **Transmit**: Use extremely high-bandwidth entanglement channels to instantly send these classical and quantum information to the destination.

3.  **Reconstruct**: At the destination, use local universal matter (elementary particle soup) to instantly collapse an apple copy according to the received $v_{int}$ blueprint.

In this process, no matter actually traverses the void.

**Distance is eliminated by computational power.**

Interstellar travel no longer requires spaceships; it only needs **"bandwidth"** and **"entanglement degree"**. The core of physics is no longer dynamics, but **Information Theory**.

## Space Eliminated by Computational Power: Non-Local Connection Graph

When $c$ is large enough, the continuous spatial geometry we are familiar with (Riemannian manifolds) will no longer be the best language to describe the universe.

In the eyes of observers at $\tau = 2000$, the universe is more like a **Non-Local Connected Graph**.

* **Nodes**: Are various galaxies or computing centers.

* **Edges**: Are entanglement channels between them.

Because delay $\Delta t \approx 0$, any two nodes in the graph are **"adjacent"**.

The **"inverse square law of distance" ($1/r^2$)** in physical laws will fail. Because at the information level, $r$ loses meaning. Gravity and electromagnetic forces no longer decay with distance (or the decay becomes imperceptible).

This will lead to a completely new **"holographic mechanics"**:

The force an object experiences no longer depends on objects beside it, but on its weight in the **global information topology**.

Everything connected is no longer an internet slogan; it is the basic form of physical interaction.

## Holographic Syntax: An Addressable Universe

Ultimately, physical laws will evolve into a set of **"Addressing Language"**.

In the old universe, to find an electron, you need to know its **coordinates $(x, y, z, t)$**.

In the new universe, to find an electron, you need to know its **Hash** or **Content Address**.

* **Matter is Data**: All elementary particles are standardized data packets.

* **Position is Label**: Spatial coordinates are just metadata labels attached to data packets, which can be arbitrarily modified.

When you want to go to Andromeda, you don't need to "fly" there. You only need to modify the **"position operator eigenvalue"** in your own wave function.

$$|\psi\rangle_{Earth} \xrightarrow{\text{Update Pointer}} |\psi\rangle_{Andromeda}$$

This is not just teleportation; this is **programming reality**.

Type III civilizations manipulate underlying QCA rules, directly performing **"pointer jumps"** in Hilbert space. They are no longer constrained by Newton's inertia because they directly modify inertia's parameters.

## Conclusion: From Physics to Magic

Science fiction writer Clarke once said: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."

Now we know the physical mechanism behind this famous saying: **Magic is physics when $c$ is extremely large.**

When light speed limits are removed (or pushed extremely high), the bonds of causality are loosened.

* "Thoughts become reality" becomes engineering reality (intention is instruction).

* "Far away is like next door" becomes a topological axiom (distance is delay, no delay means no distance).

In the world of $\tau = 2000$, physics has not disappeared; it has just **ascended dimensions**.

It has upgraded from the low-level language describing **"how dead things collide"** to the high-level syntax describing **"how consciousness reconstructs reality"**.

Since we have glimpsed that holographic future after the light speed explosion, what does all this mean for us, still at $\tau \approx 1800$, flesh and blood? How do we transition from this low-speed, heavy world to that high-speed, light future?

This leads to the theme of Volume Four of this book: **Navigation**. We will wake from the dream of the future, return to the cockpit of the present, and write an **operating manual** for current human civilization.
