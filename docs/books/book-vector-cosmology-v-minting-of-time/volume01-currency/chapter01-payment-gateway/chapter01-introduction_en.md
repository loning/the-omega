# Chapter 1: The Payment Gateway

In the prologue, we established the alchemist's view of time: time is not the void of flowing, but the minting of entities. To understand this process, we must first understand the raw materials needed for this "minting"—the universe's hard currency **$c_{FS}$**.

In macroeconomics, the flow of currency drives markets; in **Vector Cosmology**, **the flow of $c_{FS}$ budget drives existence**.

Nothing exists "naturally." Every atom, every cell, every thought must pay an expensive fee to the universe to maintain its geometric shape in Hilbert space.

This is the theme of Chapter 1: **The Payment Gateway**. We will see that life is essentially a **"Subscription Model"** service.
