# 1.1 The Rent of Existence

> "There is no free 'I.' You think you own your body, you own your consciousness. But in reality, you are only renting them. Every heartbeat is a rent payment you make to the thermodynamics counter. Once you stop paying, your structure will be reclaimed by the universe and melted into background noise."

## The Maintenance Fee of Structure

In classical physics, objects seem to have a kind of "eternality." A stone placed there, if left untouched, seems to remain a stone forever.

But from the microscopic perspective of **FS geometry**, maintaining a complex **$v_{int}$ (internal structure)** requires continuous consumption of **$c_{FS}$ budget**.

Recall our core formula:

$$v_{ext}^2 + v_{int}^2 + v_{env}^2 = c_{FS}^2$$

* **$v_{int}$** is your asset (your body, memories, order).

* **$v_{env}$** is your liability (environmental erosion, thermal noise, forgetting).

The second law of thermodynamics tells us that the universe's natural tendency is to transform $v_{int}$ into $v_{env}$.

Like a sandcastle on the beach, the waves (environmental noise) constantly want to flatten it.

To keep the castle (you) standing, you must continuously do work—that is, continuously allocate funds from the total $c_{FS}$ budget and inject them into the $v_{int}$ sector to offset the pull of $v_{env}$.

This is **"the rent of existence"**.

Living is not a static property; living is an **expensive dynamic equilibrium**.

You must pay energy (ATP) and information (error correction) every moment to barely maintain the geometric shape of "I am I" from collapsing.

## The Physical Essence of Aging: Inflation

This explains why we **age**.

Biologically, aging is telomere wear or mitochondrial damage.

In vector economics, aging is **"rising rent"** and **"declining purchasing power"**.

As intrinsic time $\tau$ progresses, although you are still paying rent, the **transaction fees ($v_{env}$ loss)** of the transaction are getting higher and higher.

* **When young**: Your metabolic system is very efficient. You pay 1 unit of $c_{FS}$ and can buy back 0.9 units of $v_{int}$ (tissue repair).

* **When old**: Your system has accumulated too many microscopic damages (geometric wrinkles). You pay 1 unit of $c_{FS}$ and can only buy back 0.5 units of $v_{int}$. The remaining 0.5 all become waste heat.

**Aging is not the passage of time; aging is the exponential rise of "maintenance costs."**

When one day, all the energy you consume (eating/breathing) is insufficient to pay the minimum rent required to maintain your structure, the system will trigger the **"bankruptcy liquidation"** procedure.

This is **death**.

## The Subscription Universe

This perspective, though harsh, is extremely clear.

We are not shareholders of the universe; we are **tenants** of the universe.

* We rent **atoms** to build our bodies.

* We rent **photons** to obtain energy.

* We rent **logic** to run our thoughts.

This tenancy relationship has a mandatory clause: **"Pay-as-you-go"**.

The universe does not accept credit. You must pay for your current existence with current actions (breathing, metabolism, thinking).

This brings us a profound sense of **urgency**.

Since every second is paid for, we cannot waste it.

If we spend expensive $c_{FS}$ budget on meaningless daydreaming, internal friction, or repetition, we are **"burning money"**. We are paying high rent but leaving the house vacant.

**Conclusion:**

Time is not free air.

Time is every coin that is burning.

Realizing this is the first step to becoming a **"time minter"**.

Since we know that every second is "spending money," where exactly are we spending it? How do we transform flowing budget into fixed history through this transaction?

This leads to the theme of the next section: **The Moment of Transaction**. We will see that the real "sense of time" does not come from the ticking of clocks, but from **the frequency of transactions**.
