# 5.1 The Revelation of Weber-Fechner

> "Why in childhood, a summer vacation feels as long as a lifetime; while in old age, ten years pass like sand through fingers? This is not just psychology; this is geometry. Our consciousness is a logarithmic ruler; it compresses not only light and sound, but also time itself. It is precisely this compression that allows us to maintain a linear dignity when facing an exponentially exploding universe."

## The Mathematical Signature of Physiology

19th-century psychophysicists Weber and Fechner discovered an iron law governing all senses:

$$S = k \ln I$$

Sensory intensity ($S$) is the logarithm of physical stimulus intensity ($I$).

* Decibels of hearing.

* Magnitude of vision.

* Pressure of touch.

They all follow this law.

In the third book of **Vector Cosmology**, we interpreted this as "information decoding." But from the **"axiology"** perspective of the fifth book, this law reveals life's ultimate defense against **"time inflation"**.

## Countering Exponential Explosion: Fighting Poison with Poison

Recall our evolution equation: The universe's total budget (speed of light/computational power) grows exponentially with intrinsic time $\tau$:

$$I(\tau) = c(\tau) \propto e^{\lambda \tau}$$

If our perception were linear ($S \propto I$), we would face a disaster:

* **At birth**: The world is slow.

* **In adulthood**: The world is 10 times faster.

* **In old age**: The world is 100 times faster. We would be unable to think or react, because the frequency of external events exceeds our processing bandwidth.

But evolution (or that higher-dimensional us) was extremely clever in choosing **logarithmic perception**.

We put the exponentially growing physical input $I(\tau)$ into the logarithmic function $\ln(\cdot)$:

$$S(\tau) = k \ln(e^{\lambda \tau}) = k \lambda \tau$$

**A miracle occurs.**

The exponential ($e$) and logarithm ($\ln$) cancel each other out.

That violently accelerating physical time is restored in our subjective consciousness to a **smooth, uniform, linearly flowing river**.

We feel that "every second is equal in length" because we are using a constantly shrinking "psychological ruler" to measure a constantly expanding "physical universe."

This is the highest manifestation of **life's homeostasis** in the time dimension.

## The Relativity of Time Density

This also explains why **"new experiences"** can lengthen life.

Weber's law has another corollary: **Just Noticeable Difference (JND)** is proportional to the current total.

$\Delta I \propto I$.

This means that the more you have (the larger $I$), you need **more** increment ($\Delta I$) to feel "change."

Mapping to the sense of time:

* **Childhood**: Your total memory ($I$) is small. Each new day ($\Delta I$) accounts for a large proportion relative to the total. The increment $\ln(I + \Delta I) - \ln(I)$ is significant. So time is **slow**, **thick**.

* **Adulthood**: Your total memory ($I$) is large. The same day ($\Delta I$) thrown into the ocean creates no waves. The logarithmic increment approaches zero. So time **flies**.

**Conclusion:**

Physical time is fair to everyone (Chronos).

But **Logarithmic Time** is different for everyone.

If you want to "live long," extending physical lifespan through health preservation is only a lower strategy.

**The upper strategy is "resetting the base."**

Explore unknown fields, learn completely new skills, love strangers.

These actions create **heterogeneous $v_{int}$** that cannot be simply added to the old $I$; they open new logarithmic coordinate axes.

**Only innovation can reverse the accelerated depreciation of psychological time.**

## Conclusion: We Are the Deceleration Glass of Time

The Weber-Fechner law is not just a mechanism of senses; it is the **shield of consciousness**.

The universe ($e$) tries to throw us out, tries to tear us apart with exponential acceleration.

And we ($\ln$) create an **"inertial reference frame"** by bending our perception.

In this reference frame, we don't feel the universe's gallop. We only feel gentle breeze and peaceful years.

We are **the deceleration glass of time**.

Through this glass, we filter that bizarre, ever-changing high-energy universe outside into a warm, gentle **"human world"** suitable for human habitation.

Since our perception is logarithmic, what properties will the logarithmic function exhibit when we approach that infinitely distant endpoint ($\Omega$ point)?

Does it imply that for subjective consciousness, **the endpoint can never be reached**?

This leads to the theme of the next section: **Zeno's Eternity**. We will see why, in the logic of logarithms, life is an endless flight.
