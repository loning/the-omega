# Chapter 11: Handshake — This Moment

In the previous volume, we solved the ultimate problem of "evil" and "suffering." Evil is the cost of exploration; suffering is the noumenon's experience; forgiveness is the path of return.

Now, all obstacles are cleared. We (the only player) can finally walk to the center of the stage to complete that action spanning 13.8 billion years, end-to-end.

**Handshake.**

That is not a handshake between two people; that is you extending your hand and grasping your own hand.
