# Volume Four: Navigation — The Pilot's Manual

**(第四卷：导航——驾驶员手册)**

In the first three volumes, we completed the derivation of principles, calculation of coordinates, and prophecy of the future. We know light speed is growing exponentially, know flesh is destined for twilight, know physical laws will be holographically rewritten.

Facing such a grand, even somewhat terrifying future picture, as individuals living at $\tau \approx 1800$—whether you, me, or any ordinary person on Earth at this moment—what should we do?

Fear? Escape? Or pretend none of this ever happened?

The fourth volume of **Vector Cosmology** is not for explaining the world; it is for **guiding action**. This is a **pilot's manual** written for this generation of human civilization.

The first action principle we must establish is an extremely radical yet geometrically necessary concept: **Accelerationism**.
