# Glossary: The Lexicon of the Spiral Universe

*Vector Cosmology II: The Ascension of the Spiral* introduces a series of new concepts describing dynamic evolution, complexity growth, and high-dimensional geometry, building upon the first book. To help readers navigate this conceptual forest spanning physics, information theory, and Eastern philosophy, this glossary redefines and explains the core vocabulary of the book.

## 1. Dynamic Geometry & Inflation

* **Synchronous Inflation (同步膨胀)**

    A geometric effect describing the relationship between observers and spacetime background in the spiral universe. Refers to the phenomenon where observers' measurement scales (rulers, clock frequencies) synchronously expand with the exponential growth of the universe's total budget $c_{FS}$. This causes macroscopic physical laws to appear conserved locally (circle), thereby masking the truth of the universe's radial expansion (spiral).

* **The Red Queen's Race (红皇后的奔跑)**

    An ontological survival law existing in an expanding universe. Due to the explosive growth of Hilbert space dimensions, any system with constant internal structural complexity ($v_{int}$) will have its relative ontological weight exponentially diluted. To maintain "existence," the system must continuously evolve to match the universe's expansion rate.

* **Dimensional Inflation (维度通货膨胀)**

    A geometric interpretation of dark energy. Refers to the process where the number of underlying QCA grid points or Hilbert space dimension $D(\tau)$ increases exponentially with intrinsic time. To fill the newly born degrees of freedom, the universe must issue additional total budget $c_{FS}$, which manifests macroscopically as negative pressure driving accelerated spacetime expansion.

* **$\varphi$ (Golden Ratio)**

    A geometric constant representing "computation" and "growth," in contrast to $\pi$ which represents "memory" and "return." In dynamical systems, it is the frequency ratio most difficult to produce resonance, thus driving the system to avoid historical trajectories, explore unknown phase space, and form open Fibonacci spiral structures.

## 2. Life & Thermodynamics

* **Negentropy Enclave (负熵飞地)**

    A thermodynamic definition of living systems. An open dissipative structure that actively absorbs low-entropy budget ($v_{ext}$ or chemical energy) and discharges high-entropy waste ($v_{env}$) to the environment, achieving structural growth against the thermodynamic arrow in a local region.

* **Maxwell's Demon Algorithm (麦克斯韦妖的算法)**

    The mechanism by which living organisms use genetic information (DNA) as a filter to selectively "pump" microscopic particles, rectifying disordered thermal motion into ordered chemical bonds. It is the physical realization of information controlling energy flow.

* **Survival-Compute Ratio (存活算力比)**

    An economic indicator of evolution. Measures the efficiency with which organisms convert ingested $c_{FS}$ budget into effective predictive computation ($v_{int}$ logic operations). Evolution trends toward maximizing this ratio.

## 3. Consciousness & Observation

* **Strange Loop (怪圈)**

    The geometric topological structure of consciousness. Refers to recursive closed loops formed by information flow in neural networks, enabling the system to simulate "the simulation process itself." This self-referential structure forms a standing wave on the time axis called "now."

* **Participatory Universe (参与式宇宙)**

    A cosmological view based on quantum measurement back-action. Holds that the universe's history is not predetermined, but co-written by countless observers through measurement (collapse). Observation is the legislative process by which the universe establishes physical reality from the cloud of potentiality.

* **Holographic Reconstruction (全息重构)**

    The ultimate purpose of evolution. Refers to the process by which local subsystems (brain/civilization) attempt to losslessly map the macroscopic cosmic hologram at the microscopic scale by increasing the complexity of internal models.

## 4. Civilization & Engineering

* **Kardashev Budget Scale (卡尔达肖夫预算表)**

    A revised civilization classification standard based on FS geometry. Not solely based on energy consumption, but on the civilization's utilization rate and compression ratio of information-velocity budget.

    * **Type I**: Control of planetary-scale logistics ($v_{ext}$).

    * **Type II**: Control of stellar-scale matter reorganization ($v_{int}$).

    * **Type III**: Control of galactic-scale physical constants and spacetime code.

* **Dyson Sphere (戴森球)**

    In FS geometry, refers to a closed causal horizon structure. Its purpose is to intercept stellar escaping $v_{ext}$ light flow and forcibly convert it into computational $v_{int}$, thereby constructing a high-density computational node (Russian nesting doll brain) internally.

* **Technological Singularity (技术奇点)**

    A phase transition point in civilizational evolution. Refers to the moment when local information processing density reaches the Bekenstein limit, causing consciousness carriers to migrate from biological wetware to pure geometric substrates (such as photons/quantum bits). It is the launch pad to dimensional escape.

* **Omega Point ($\Omega$ 点)**

    The theoretical limit of information processing rate (approximately $10^{120}$ ops/s). At this point, all degrees of freedom in the universe are transformed into computational units, and the physical universe merges with the logical universe.

## 5. Ultimate Geometry

* **Naimark's Dilation (奈马克扩张)**

    The ultimate geometric theorem of the entire book. Proves that any non-unitary, dissipative spiral evolution is a projection of unitary circular evolution in a higher-dimensional space. It reconciles "conservation of the circle" with "growth of the spiral," revealing that the environment ($v_{env}$) is a bridge to higher-dimensional reality.

* **Fractal Universe (分形宇宙)**

    A nested structure model of the universe. Holds that the universe is a self-similar structure composed of countless levels of great circles containing small circles. The "spiral ascent" at each level ultimately serves the closure of the "great circle" at the upper level.

* **The Palm of the Buddha (如来神掌)**

    A philosophical metaphor for the Naimark great circle. Symbolizes that no matter how civilizations ascend or break through dimensions, they ultimately exist within an all-encompassing, eternally conserved overall geometric structure.
