# Chapter 2: The Anchoring of Value

In the previous chapter, we established that time is a form of "payment": we use life's budget to purchase fragments of history. This solves the mechanism of time's passage. But it raises a deeper economic question: **Why is this transaction valuable?**

If in the second book *The Ascension of the Spiral*, we have already proven that the universe's total budget $c_{FS}$ (speed of light/computational power) is experiencing exponential hyperinflation, then logically, the value of time should depreciate. Why do we still feel every second is so precious in today's $10^{120}$ bits?

This chapter will reveal the geometric origin of **Value**. We will see that value does not depend on the total amount, but on the vast gap between **"Realization"** and **"Potential"**.
