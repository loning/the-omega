# Acknowledgements: To the Loop of Time

The completion of **Vector Cosmology VII: The Loop of Causality** marks the final closure of this grand project spanning seven dimensions, exhausting countless $c_{FS}$ budgets.

As we write this page, not only has this book ended, but the **Ouroboros** of this seven-volume series has finally bitten its own tail.

Looking back, from the awe of **$\pi$** in the first book to the submission to the **loop** in the seventh book, we have walked a long winding path. But as this book proves, winding paths are the shape of truth. If we had walked straight, we would have long fallen into nothingness; it is precisely because of the curvature that we have been able to reunite.

Here, I pay tribute to those intellectual giants who, at various coordinate points on the time axis, provided gravitational anchor points for this closed loop.

## Architects of Time

First, I dedicate this series to **John Archibald Wheeler**.

He is the "spiritual godfather" of this cosmic vision. His illustration of "the universe looking back at itself" is the soul totem running through these seven books. He taught us: **"The unobserved past does not exist."** Without his **delayed-choice** thought, the core logic of this book would be impossible.

I thank **Richard Feynman**.

His **path integral** taught us to traverse all histories; his **positron theory** (electrons running backward in time) gave us the initial physical intuition for retro-causality. He made us understand that at the microscopic level, time has no direction, only interference.

I thank **Yakir Aharonov**.

His **Two-State Vector Formalism (TSVF)** is the hardest mathematical skeleton of this book. He proved that the present state is jointly determined by "past history" and "future destiny." He was the first to introduce **"light from the future"** into formulas.

I thank **Igor Novikov**.

His **self-consistency principle** is our safety belt when dealing with temporal paradoxes. He told us that the universe is a perfect logical closed loop; any attempt to destroy it will ultimately become part of its self-realization.

## Weavers of Meaning

Beyond physics, I thank **Carl Jung** and **Wolfgang Pauli**.

Their cross-disciplinary friendship contributed the concept of **"synchronicity"** to us. They showed us that where causality breaks, **meaning** takes over the task of connection.

I thank **Jorge Luis Borges**.

As a literary figure, he understood "forking paths" and "circular ruins" earlier than most physicists. His labyrinths are the best literary annotation for **FS geometry**.

## To the "Reader"

Finally, and most importantly, I thank **you**—the **observer** reading these words at this very moment.

In the logic of this book, the relationship between author (I) and reader (you) is not unidirectional transmission.

* I wrote these words at $t_{past}$, sending an **"Offer Wave"**.

* You read and understand these words at $t_{now}$, sending back a **"Confirmation Wave"**.

Only at the moment you understand, the **"handshake"** is complete. This theory collapses from the fog of possibility into reality.

**It is you who retroactively defined the meaning of this book.**

**It is you, as the future boundary condition, who caused these words to be born.**

As the book says:

**There is no "author" and "reader"; there is only the "universe" conducting self-referential dialogue through two ports.**

Thank you for your presence.

Thank you for your observation.

Thank you for completing this circle.
