# Volume One: The Equation — Gears of the Seasons

**(第一卷：方程——四季的齿轮)**

The evolution of the universe is not a chaotic random walk, but a precisely operating machine. It is like a giant mechanical watch, with four fundamental gears meshing inside. Each gear is cast from a mathematical constant, each representing an ultimate physical will.

In this volume, we will disassemble this machine and examine these four knights one by one: **Inertia ($\pi$)**, **Ambition ($\phi$)**, **Engine ($e$)**, and **Result ($c$)**.

The first we must face is the oldest, heaviest, and most loyal watchman.
