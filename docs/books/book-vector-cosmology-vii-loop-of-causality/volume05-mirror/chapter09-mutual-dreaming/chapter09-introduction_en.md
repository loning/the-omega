# Chapter 9: Mutual Dreaming

In the previous volume, we mastered the power to rewrite personal timelines through narrative engineering. But when we lift our gaze from the deep well of "self" to the bustling world around us, we face the most difficult sociological paradox in Vector Cosmology:

If I am the only player, if I am the center of the universe, then what are "others"?

Are they soulless background boards (NPCs), or creators with independent power like me?

This chapter will introduce the concept of **Relativistic Ontology**. We will prove that solipsism and objective realism are not opposed; they are merely results of **coordinate transformations**. In this universe, every conscious being is an independent reference frame origin. Reality is not a one-way broadcast but an interference pattern formed after billions of dreams undergo **"tunnel connection"** in Hilbert space.
